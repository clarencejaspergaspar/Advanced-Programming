**Overview**

This repository is created to showcase various programming activities, specifically Python programming. It will serve both as a submission bin and a portfolio for Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms. All activities are developed using Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda) and then exported and uploaded here to GitHub. Each activity demonstrates different Python concepts, functions, and problem-solving approaches in the course.

üìå **Tools Used**

*Anaconda* ‚Äì to manage Python environments and launch Jupyter Notebook.

*Jupyter Notebook* ‚Äì to write, run, and test Python programs interactively.

*GitHub* ‚Äì to store and showcase my Python programming activities.
<br><br>



üìù **Workflow**

1. Write Code in Jupyter Notebook

    - Open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator.

    - Create a python(.ipynb) file for each activity.

    - Use functions, loops, and other Python concepts to solve tasks.

2. Export Activity

    - Save work as .ipynb which is the default Jupyter format.

3. Upload to GitHub

    - Create a new repository in GitHub.

    - Upload the .ipynb file(s) to the repository.

4. Organize Portfolio

    - Each activity will have its own section in this README.

Tasks will be documented with short explanations and screenshots.
