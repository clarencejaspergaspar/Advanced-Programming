**Overview**

This repository is created to showcase various programming activities, specifically Python programming. It will serve both as a submission bin and a portfolio for Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms. All activities are developed using Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda) and then exported and uploaded here to GitHub. Each activity demonstrates different Python concepts, functions, and problem-solving approaches in the course.

üìå **Tools Used**

*Anaconda* ‚Äì to manage Python environments and launch Jupyter Notebook.

*Jupyter Notebook* ‚Äì to write, run, and test Python programs interactively.

*GitHub* ‚Äì to store and showcase my Python programming activities.
<br><br>



üìù **Workflow**

1. Write Code in Jupyter Notebook

    - Open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator.

    - Create a python(.ipynb) file for each activity.

    - Use functions, loops, and other Python concepts to solve tasks.

2. Export Activity

    - Save work as .ipynb which is the default Jupyter format.

3. Upload to GitHub

    - Create a new repository in GitHub.

    - Upload the .ipynb file(s) to the repository.

4. Organize Portfolio

    - Each activity will have its own section in this README.

üìÇ **Activities**
üîπ *Activity 1*

This activity introduced basic Python programming using Jupyter Notebook.

Tasks Completed: *The python file already contains brief comments as guidelines and explanations for reader* 

- Task 1: Alphabet Soup Problem:
  
  The program defines a function called arrange that takes a string and arranges its letters alphabetically. This is done by using sorted() to order the characters and join() to combine them back into a single string. The user is then asked to input a word, which is passed to the function. Finally, the arranged letters are displayed, showing the word‚Äôs characters sorted from A to Z.


- Task 2: Emoticon Problem:

  The program defines a function called convert that changes specific words in a sentence into their corresponding emoticons. A dictionary is used to store the word‚Äìemoticon pairs, such as ‚Äúsmile‚Äù ‚Üí :) and ‚Äúsad‚Äù ‚Üí :((. The sentence is split into individual words, and the function checks each one to see if it matches a key in the dictionary. If it does, the word is replaced with the corresponding emoticon. After processing, the words are joined back into a complete sentence. The program demonstrates this with an example and then allows the user to enter their own sentence, which is converted into emoticons and displayed as output.

- Task 3: Unpacking List Problem:

  The program starts with a list of numbers and demonstrates how to access specific elements using their indexes. The first element is obtained with list[0], since indexing begins at zero. The middle portion is extracted with list[1:-1], which selects all elements from the second up to the second-to-last. The last element is accessed using list[-1], where negative indexing counts from the end of the list. Finally, the program prints the first, middle, and last parts separately, showing how list slicing and indexing can classify elements based on their placement.
